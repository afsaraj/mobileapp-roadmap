# 📱 Mobile App Development Roadmap (Flutter + React Native) – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal
Master cross-platform mobile app development using **Flutter** (Dart) and **React Native** (JavaScript/TypeScript), including UI design, native APIs, state management, real-time features, and app store deployment.

This roadmap will guide you from basic mobile dev to fully functional apps that work on both iOS and Android.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Mobile Development Fundamentals

### 🧠 Concepts
- Native vs Cross-platform
- Android/iOS architecture
- Navigation, views, gestures, lifecycle
- Responsive design & pixel density

### Tools
- Android Studio / VSCode
- Emulators + Physical Device Testing
- Git + GitHub for version control

📦 **Project**: “Hello App” – Text, image, and basic navigation screen

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Flutter Basics (Dart)

### Topics
- Widgets, layout (Column, Row, Stack)
- State: StatefulWidget vs StatelessWidget
- Navigation (named routes, arguments)
- Theming, icons, fonts

📦 **Project**: To-do list with UI, add/edit/delete, local state

---

## 📍 Phase 3: React Native Basics (JS/TS)

### Topics
- Components, props, hooks
- Navigation (React Navigation)
- FlatList, ScrollView, Pressable
- Styling (StyleSheet, TailwindCSS RN)

📦 **Project**: Notes app with navigation + color themes

---

## 📍 Phase 4: State Management

### Flutter
- Provider, Riverpod, Bloc (optional)

### React Native
- Context API, Redux Toolkit, Zustand

📦 **Project**: Expense Tracker – uses persistent state + charts

---

## 📍 Phase 5: APIs, Networking, Storage

### Topics
- REST APIs, JSON parsing
- Async handling (Future, Promises)
- Secure storage (keychain, shared prefs)
- Local storage: SQLite, Hive, AsyncStorage

📦 **Project**: Weather App (API calls + user location + cache)

---

## 📍 Phase 6: UI/UX Mastery + Animation

### Topics
- Custom components, modals, bottom sheets
- Animations (Lottie, built-in transitions)
- Dark mode, adaptive layouts
- Accessibility best practices

📦 **Project**: Music Player UI clone with smooth animations

---

## 📍 Phase 7: Native APIs + Device Features

### Topics
- Camera, gallery, geolocation
- Push notifications (Firebase FCM)
- Permissions, background tasks
- Sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)

📦 **Project**: Fitness Tracker – step count, GPS map, camera-based workout log

---

## 📍 Phase 8: Testing + CI/CD + App Store Deployment

### Testing
- Flutter: Widget tests, integration tests
- React Native: Jest, Detox (e2e)

### CI/CD
- Codemagic / Bitrise / GitHub Actions

### Publishing
- iOS build + provisioning + TestFlight
- Android APK/AAB + Play Console setup

📦 **Deliverables**: Production-ready app deployed to both app stores
